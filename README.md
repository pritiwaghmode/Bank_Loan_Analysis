The objective was to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time, aiding data-driven decision-making, tracking loan portfolio health, and identifying trends for lending strategy.

KPI Requirements

Total Loan Applications: Compute the total number of loan applications received during a specific time period. Monitor changes on a month-to-date (MTD) , month-over-month (MoM) ,previous-year-MTD (PY-MTD)basis.

Total Funded Amount: Comprehend the total amount of funds disbursed as loans. Illustrate MTD , MoM and PY-MTD changes.

Total Amount Received: Track the total amount received from borrowers to assess the bank's cash flow from repayments. Analyze MTD , MoM and PY-MTD changes.

Average Interest Rate: Calculate the average interest rate across all loans. Monitor MTD, MoM and PY-MTD variations to gain insights into the overall cost of the lending portfolio.
